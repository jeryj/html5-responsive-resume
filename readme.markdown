HTML5 Responsive Résumé
========================

It's responsive! It's HTML5! It's a résumé!

There's really not much HTML5 specific stuff here. The document is so simple that the extent of the HTML5 is just 'main role="main"' The role part is even pretty debatable there.


Set-up
============

- Change the name, content, etc. It's all my personal résumé. You should probably make it your own.
- Change the fonts. I'm using Adobe Caslon Pro from typekit. Formal, stylish, and very readable for headings and body text. Switch it out if you don't have a typekit account, or switch it out anyways.


Design considerations
=====================

I wanted to create something extremely simple and tasteful to show respect for traditional résumés. There's no flash or trendiness here.

Section titles (Experience, Education, etc) are h2s, but they're small. Those aren't the important parts of your resume. So, our h3s that are used for workplaces and higher-ed are actually much bigger. That's what you want to highlight on your résumé. Sometimes you have to break tradition while keeping your HTML semantics legit.

With Adobe Caslon Pro, I kept the font size smaller and heavily reduced the width on desktop to get a good character count on each line (about 75). Check your character count if you switch out the font or increase the size.
