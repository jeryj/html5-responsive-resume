    <h2 class="work-section-title">Code Examples</h2>

    <h3 class="workplace">Basic, Basic Math</h3>
    <p class="time-worked no-work-link"><time datetime="2013-11">November 2013</time></p>

    <p>I needed a simple math program for my son to do rote math problems on. So I created my <a href="http://jeremyjon.es/basic-math">"basic, basic math" application</a> using javascript (with jQuery help), CSS, &amp; HTML. This pushed my limits of javascript knowledge at the time.</p>

    <p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/jeryj/basic-math">view the basic math code on github</a>.

    <!--<h2 class="work-section-title">Design &amp; Code - In Depth</h2>
    <h3 class="workplace">Reclaimed Enterprises</h3>
    <p>Reclaimed Enterprises (RE) deconstructs old homes and reclaims the materials while telling its story from original construction to selling remade products from their artisans.</p>

    <p>I was in charge of designing and coding a system that would highlight those stories and connections to their main users:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Consumers looking to buy artisan products</li>
        <li>Contractors &amp; architects looking for raw materials</li>
        <li>Government officials and potential business / non-profit partners.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because the users had such diverse needs, the line between ecommerce and an informational site was blurred. To address this, I designed and built systems such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A menu layout that quickly segments users. I gave a different background to the shop menu items to connect them while setting them off from the other links, and faded the "shop" link to make it less desirable to click on.</li>
        <li>All products can include multiple artisans or properties. These are highlighted on the individual product page so users can get a quick overview of the them, see more products from them, and jump over to the full page about them.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>RE is one person managing all these areas. He doesn't have time to learn intricacies of managing his site, so I made it as easy as possible by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating custom post types (CPT) for artisans, properties, and partners with all meta fields necessary for data entry and creating the pages.</li>
        <li>Each CPT entry he creates or edits will automatically create or update the corresponding artisan / partner / property shop category, image, and description so he doesn't have to edit anything twice. Ever.</li>
        <li>The shop menu categories are automatically updated based on in-stock items from faceted menus.</li>
        <li>Property totals featured on the homepage (tons saved from landfill, hours worked, etc) are automatically calculated based on the property data he enters. Each time he publishes or updates a property, my code loops through all the fields, calculates the data, and writes it to a single database entry.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Wordpress was the preferred platform of the client, but I was concerned about performance. My research led me to <a href="https://shopplugin.net/">Shopp Plugin</a>, a developer friendly, performance-focused ecommerce system for Wordpress. Shopp is powerful for developers, but does not have great usability or design. Because of this, I:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>redesigned and customized every shop page,</li>
        <li>rewrote the entire checkout flow to be specific to their users and goals,</li>
        <li>coded unobtrusive form validation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Reclaimed Enterprises' website is still being populated. My code expects the unexpected by serving different layouts depending on what content is available and what isn't.</p>

    <p>This site was a great experience for me because it challenged me to design for a complex user combination with multiple desired outcomes. My code is well commented, and Messenger Pigeons (a company I co-founded) will provide ongoing updates and tweaks as more content and users generate adequate data to make those decisions.</p>-->
